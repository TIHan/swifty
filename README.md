# Swifty
Swifty is a toy web framework built in Elixir that sits on top of [Elli](https://github.com/knutin/elli). This project is a playground for me to learn Elixir. **This could be the worst idea ever.**

## Goals
* Routes near the method being executed.
* Resources discovered via (overridable) conventions.
* A Clean way to shape and validate the data coming in.
* Handlers shouldn't care about the source(s) of data.
* Handlers shouldn't care about the format of outgoing data.
